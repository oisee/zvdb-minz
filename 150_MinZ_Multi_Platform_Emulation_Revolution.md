# 150. MinZ Multi-Platform Emulation Revolution: Complete Z80 Development Toolchain

*August 7, 2025 - A Night of Unprecedented Achievement*

## 🚀 The Revolution Accomplished

Tonight marked a historic milestone in vintage computing: the completion of a **complete Z80 development ecosystem** that bridges 40+ years of computing evolution. What started as debugging broken symlinks evolved into a **revolutionary multi-platform development experience**.

## ⚡ Core Achievements: The Complete Toolchain

### **mz** - The MinZ Compiler Suite
```bash
# Universal compilation to all targets
mz compile program.minz -t z80      # → Z80 assembly
mz compile program.minz -t llvm     # → LLVM IR  
mz compile program.minz -t c        # → C code
mz compile program.minz -t wasm     # → WebAssembly
```

### **mza** - The Modern Z80 Assembler  
```bash
# Revolutionary features for 2025
mza input.a80 -o output.bin -l listing.txt -s symbols.sym

# Character literal support - BREAKTHROUGH FEATURE!  
LD A, 'H'    # Compiles to: LD A, 72
LD B, 'I'    # Modern convenience on vintage hardware
```

### **mze** - Multi-Platform Z80 Emulator with System Call Interception
```bash
# Multi-platform execution with host I/O redirection
mze program.bin -m spectrum -a #8000    # ZX Spectrum mode
mze program.bin -m cpm -a 0x0100        # CP/M mode  
mze program.bin -m cpc -a $8000         # Amstrad CPC mode

# Revolutionary RST interception for seamless debugging:
# RST $10 → stdout on host (print character)
# RST $18 → stdin from host (get character) 
# RST $20 → advanced I/O operations
```

### **mzr** - Interactive REPL Environment
```bash
mzr  # Start interactive MinZ session
# Fixed infinite loop on EOF - now production ready!
```

## 🔬 Technical Breakthroughs Achieved

### 1. **Character Literal Revolution**
```assembly
; Before (painful)
LD A, 72    ; What is 72? Need ASCII table!

; After (revolutionary)  
LD A, 'H'   ; Instant clarity! Modern convenience!
```

### 2. **Multi-Platform System Call Interception**

**ZX Spectrum Mode:**
- RST $10: Print character to host stdout
- RST $18: Collect character from host stdin  
- RST $20: Collect next character operations

**CP/M Mode:**
- RST $28: BDOS system calls with function routing
- Function 2: Character output → host stdout
- Function 1: Character input ← host stdin

**Amstrad CPC Mode:**
- Platform-specific firmware call interception
- Graphics and sound system integration ready

### 3. **Revolutionary HALT Detection Logic**
```assembly
; BREAKTHROUGH: Proper program termination detection
DI          ; Disable interrupts
HALT        ; → Program termination (exit emulator)

; vs.

HALT        ; → Wait for interrupt (continue with 50Hz simulation!)
```

### 4. **50Hz Interrupt Simulation Framework**
- Authentic ZX Spectrum interrupt timing
- Proper HALT instruction semantics  
- Ready for advanced demos and games

### 5. **Universal Hex Address Format Support**
```bash
mze program.bin -a #8000    # ZX Spectrum style
mze program.bin -a $8000    # Assembly style
mze program.bin -a 0x8000   # C style
# All formats work seamlessly!
```

## 💎 Revolutionary Impact

### **Speed of Development: Assembly → Minutes!**
```bash
# The new TDD workflow:
echo "LD A, 'H'" > hello.a80
echo "RST 16" >> hello.a80        # Print to stdout
echo "DI" >> hello.a80
echo "HALT" >> hello.a80          # Proper termination

mza hello.a80 -o hello.bin        # Assemble (instant)
mze hello.bin -m spectrum         # Execute (instant)
# Output: H
```

### **Cross-Platform Magic**
- Write once in Z80 assembly
- Run on ZX Spectrum, CP/M, CPC modes
- Host I/O integration seamless
- Perfect for retro game development

### **Educational Revolution**  
- Learn Z80 assembly with modern tools
- Character literals make code readable
- Instant feedback loop
- No hardware needed for development

## 🔥 The Next Big Thing: Future Vision

### **TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) Integration**
```bash
mze game.bin -m spectrum --record speedrun.tas
# Revolutionary precision input recording
```

### **Advanced Graphics Intercepts**
```assembly
; Future capability
OUT (254), A    # Border color → host graphics
# UDG character redefinition → modern displays
# Paper/ink changes → full color mapping
```

### **Multi-Target Backend Integration**
```bash
# Environment variable magic
export MINZ_BACKEND=llvm
export MINZ_TARGET=spectrum

mz compile retro_game.minz  # → LLVM-optimized Z80!
```

### **Snapshot File Generation**
```bash
mze program.bin -m spectrum --snapshot game.sna
# Generate .SNA/.Z80 files for real hardware!
```
